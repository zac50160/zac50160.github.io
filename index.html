<p>The second shot at the 11th, all of the 12th, 
and the first two shots at the 13th hole at Augusta are nicknamed "Amen Corner".</p>
<p>This term was first used in print by author Herbert Warren Wind in his April 21, 1958, Sports Illustrated article about the Masters that year. 
In a Golf Digest article in April 1984, 26 years later, Wind told about its origin.</p>
<p>He said he wanted a catchy phrase like baseball's "hot-corner" or football's "coffin-corner"
 to explain where some of the most exciting golf had taken place. Thus "Amen Corner" was born.</p>
